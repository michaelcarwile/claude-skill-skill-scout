## What Makes a Good CLAUDE.md

Key patterns from the best examples:

1. **Project context** — What the project is, its architecture, key dependencies
2. **Code conventions** — Naming, formatting, patterns the project follows
3. **Testing instructions** — How to run tests, what framework, coverage expectations
4. **Build & deploy** — Build commands, environment setup, deployment process
5. **Common tasks** — Frequently performed operations with exact commands
6. **Gotchas** — Things that are easy to get wrong in this specific project
